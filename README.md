# Flecher-s-Sales-Performance-Analysis-2019-# 📊 Flecher’s Sales Performance Analysis – 2019

A data analytics project focused on uncovering business insights from Flecher’s 2019 transactional sales data. This project was developed as part of my coursework at **Vephla University's School of Data Sciences and Data Engineering**, where I’m currently pursuing a Diploma in Data Analytics.

## 📌 Project Overview

This analysis investigates the performance of Flecher’s sales operations across different regions, product categories, sales representatives, and time periods in 2019. Using Microsoft Excel as the primary tool, I cleaned, organized, and analyzed the dataset to extract strategic insights for improving future business outcomes.

The project not only examines what drove high revenues but also offers targeted, data-driven **recommendations** for staff optimization, regional strategy improvement, inventory management, and customer retention.
